# AWS_Roadmap
In this repository we will discuss the road map. And I like to talk about the Basic to professional approach for AWS.

why Aws is mostly used ?

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a popular choice for cloud computing services for several reasons :

  Broad Range of Services: AWS offers a vast array of cloud services, including computing power, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), security, and more. This comprehensive suite of services caters to diverse business needs, making AWS a one-stop solution for various cloud requirements.

Scalability and Flexibility: AWS provides flexible and scalable infrastructure that can accommodate both small-scale and large-scale workloads. Businesses can easily scale their resources up or down based on demand, ensuring they only pay for what they use. This scalability allows for cost optimization and the ability to handle sudden spikes in traffic or computational requirements.

Global Infrastructure: AWS operates a vast network of data centers spread across multiple geographic regions worldwide. This extensive infrastructure allows businesses to deploy their applications and services closer to their customers, reducing latency and providing a better user experience. Additionally, AWS provides various availability zones within each region to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Reliability and Resilience: AWS offers robust and reliable infrastructure, with redundant systems and built-in failover mechanisms. This ensures that applications and services hosted on AWS remain highly available even in the event of hardware failures or other disruptions. AWS also provides backup and disaster recovery solutions to protect data and minimize downtime.

Security: AWS places a strong emphasis on security and provides a wide range of security features and services. These include identity and access management (IAM), network security, encryption, monitoring, logging, and compliance with various industry standards and regulations. AWS adheres to strict security practices and provides tools to help users secure their applications and data.

Cost-Effective: AWS offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, enabling businesses to avoid upfront infrastructure costs. With on-demand pricing and the ability to scale resources, businesses can optimize their costs and pay only for the resources they consume. AWS also provides various pricing options, such as reserved instances and spot instances, for further cost savings.

Ecosystem and Integration: AWS has a vibrant ecosystem with a wide range of third-party integrations, tools, and services. This ecosystem allows businesses to leverage additional functionalities and easily integrate their AWS infrastructure with other software and systems. The extensive documentation, developer tools, and community support further enhance the development and deployment experience on AWS.
